Table. Estimates of Evolutionary Divergence between Sequences
The number of amino acid substitutions per site from between sequences are shown. Analyses were conducted using the Poisson correction model [1]. This analysis involved 4 amino acid sequences. All ambiguous positions were removed for each sequence pair (pairwise deletion option). There were a total of 447 positions in the final dataset. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA11 [2][3]
